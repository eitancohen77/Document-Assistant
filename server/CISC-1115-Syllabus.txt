CISC 1115 Introduction to Programming Using Java
3 hours lecture, 2 hours lab; 4 credits
Bulletin Description
Algorithms, computers and programs. Writing, debugging, and testing programs. Loops and
conditional control structures. Method definition and parameter passing. Arrays, ArrayLists, and
Strings. Sorting, searching and other basic algorithms. Input and output. Programming applications
selected from various disciplines. History and basic concepts of computer science. (Not open to
students who have completed Computer and Information Science 1110 [1.5].)
Prerequisite: none
Contact hours: 5
Department Goals Addressed by Course:
1. Prepare students for the programming requirements in the computer science, information
systems or multimedia majors.
2. Prepare students for occasional software development in other disciplines.
Objectives of Course:
1. Understand the concept of a program (i.e., a computer following a series of instructions)
2. Declare a variable with an appropriate data type (either character or numeric or boolean),
initialize the variable's value, and change the value when appropriate
3. Use control structures, including a loop to repeat the execution of a series of statements
and a conditional statement to select one from a series of alternatives
4. Write a method to perform a subtask and use the method as part of a larger program
5. Use arrays to store multiple pieces of homogeneous data
6. Trace the execution of a program and predict the results of the execution
7. Write an algorithm for a simple task.
Outcomes Anticipated for Course: At the completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Write, test and debug simple programs that use the imperative and procedural paradigms to
solve data processing problems involving single streams of input and output.
2. Use iteration to process data stored in a collection and variable quantities of input data.
3. Apply common iterative algorithms such as sorting, searching, and simple mathematical
calculations.
